["index.html", "Omics Central Chapter 1 Rationale", " Omics Central Amrit Singh 2020-01-08 Chapter 1 Rationale This project was developed in order to create a resource warehouse for researchers analyze omics datasets of various types such as transcriptomics, proteomcs, metabolomics. I expect this resource to grow as others contribute to it. Think of it as an awesome-resource github repo but in a bookdown format. However, since this book is meant as documentation to the omics central web application, adding new methods will require pull requests to the omics central web app repos (omics-central-frontend, omics-central-backend and omics-central-docker) and bookdown repos (omics-central-learn and omics-central-contribute). The purpose of this book is not to copy, paste other works but to link works by different authors in one place and explain concepts through the lens of an omics researcher. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
