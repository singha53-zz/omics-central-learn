### hypergeometric tests

#### hypergeometric probabilities

* The sample space consists of a total of n genes, out of which m genes belong to Pathway A. Select k genes at random (without replacement). What is the probability that i of the selected genes belong to Pathway A.
* parameters include:
  * n: total number of genes observed
  * m: number of genes in Pathway A
  * k: genes selected at random
  * i: number of selected genes that belong to Pathway A

Size of sample space (\(\Omega \)) = \(n \choose k \): all ways to draw k genes from n genes
Event of interest: # of ways to get i genes from Pathway A after drawing k genes = (# of ways to select i genes from Pathway A from a total of m genes in Pathway A, \(m \choose i \)) x (# of ways to get k-i from the remaining n-m genes not in Pathway A, \(n-m \choose k-i \))

Prob = $\frac{\binom{m}{i}\binom{n-m}{k-i}}{n \choose k}$
