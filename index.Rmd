# Rationale

This project was developed in order to create a resource warehouse for researchers analyzing omics datasets of various types such as transcriptomics, proteomcs, metabolomics. I expect this resource to grow as others contribute to it. Think of it as an awesome-resource github repo but in a bookdown format. However, since this book is meant as documentation to the omics central web application, adding new methods will require pull requests to the omics central web app repos (omics-central-frontend, omics-central-backend and omics-central-docker) and bookdown repos ([omics-central-learn](https://github.com/singha53/omics-central-learn) and omics-central-contribute [omics-central-learn](https://github.com/singha53/omics-central-contribute)).
